ARCHITECTURE COMPARISON (architecture_comparison.png)
================================================================================

CLASSICAL PIPELINE:
  1. Savitzky-Golay Filter (window=31, polynomial=3)
     - Smooths noise while preserving peak shapes
     - Computationally efficient O(n) complexity
     - Works by fitting local polynomial approximations

  2. Asymmetric Least Squares (AsLS) Baseline Correction
     - Removes instrumental drift and background emission
     - Parameters: lambda=1e5 (smoothness), p=0.01 (asymmetry)
     - Iteratively fits baseline below peaks

  3. Peak Detection (scipy.signal.find_peaks)
     - Identifies emission lines based on prominence
     - Threshold: 15% of maximum intensity
     - Returns peak positions, heights, and widths

DEEP LEARNING PIPELINE:
  1. 1D Convolutional Autoencoder (7,153 parameters)
     - Encoder: 3 Conv1D layers with downsampling
     - Latent space: Compressed signal representation
     - Decoder: 3 Conv1D layers with upsampling
     - Trained on 60 windows (256 points each) for 3 epochs

  2. Same baseline correction and peak detection as classical

KEY DIFFERENCES:
  • Classical: Fixed parameters, interpretable, fast
  • Deep Learning: Adaptive, learns from data, requires training
  • Classical is preferred when: Speed critical, no training data
  • DL is preferred when: Complex noise patterns, abundant training data

DETAILED RESULTS INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

1. SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO (SNR) ANALYSIS (compare_snr_bar.png)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS SNR?
  SNR measures signal quality by comparing signal power to noise power.
  Formula: SNR (dB) = 10 * log10(Signal_Power / Noise_Power)
  Higher SNR = Better signal quality = More accurate measurements

HOW WE CALCULATED IT:
  • Noise reference: First 50 samples (baseline region)
  • Signal power: Mean squared value of entire signal
  • Noise power: Variance of noise reference region

RESULTS ACHIEVED:
  • Raw signals: Average baseline SNR
  • Classical processing: +13.63 dB improvement
  • Deep learning: +-1.69 dB improvement

SIGNIFICANCE:
  Classical method OUTPERFORMED DL by 15.31 dB.
  This suggests classical filters are well-tuned for this noise type.

PRACTICAL IMPACT:
  • 3 dB improvement = 2x better signal quality
  • 13.6 dB = 23.3x quality improvement
  • Better SNR -> More accurate elemental concentration measurements
  • Improved reliability in cement composition analysis

2. PEAK DETECTION PERFORMANCE (peak_detection_table.png)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS PEAK DETECTION?
  Peak detection identifies emission lines (spectral peaks) that correspond
  to specific chemical elements. Each element emits light at characteristic
  wavelengths when excited, creating peaks in the intensity signal.

EVALUATION METRICS:
  • Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
    -> Of detected peaks, what % are real?
    -> High precision = Few false alarms

  • Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
    -> Of real peaks, what % were detected?
    -> High recall = Few missed peaks

  • Position Error = Average distance from true peak location
    -> Measured in scan indices (lower is better)

RESULTS ACHIEVED:
  Classical Method:
    • Precision: 13.94% (detected 7 peaks per real peak)
    • Recall: 100.00% (found 100% of all peaks)
    • Position Error: 3.90 scan indices

  Deep Learning Method:
    • Precision: 5.20% (detected 19 peaks per real peak)
    • Recall: 70.00% (found 70% of all peaks)
    • Position Error: 12.56 scan indices

INTERPRETATION:

  LOW PRECISION: Many false positives detected.
  CAUSES:
    • Noise fluctuations mistaken for peaks
    • Baseline ripples creating spurious peaks
    • Prominence threshold may need tuning
  SOLUTIONS:
    • Increase prominence threshold (currently 15%)
    • Apply stricter width/height ratio filters
    • Use matched filter for expected peak shapes

PRACTICAL IMPACT:
  • High recall ensures no elements are missed in analysis
  • Low precision means analyst must verify detected peaks
  • False positives can be filtered using:
    - Wavelength databases (expected emission lines)
    - Peak shape analysis (Gaussian/Lorentzian fitting)
    - Multi-channel consistency checks
